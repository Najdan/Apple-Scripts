# Microsoft Teams Starter Script

## Description
On macOS Microsoft Teams has an issue after update. When application is updated it closes but does not start again. This may be big issue since Microsoft Teams is work related app and you are supposed to be available to other colleagues. Because of this issue I created Apple Script which checks if Microsoft Teams is running and if it's not then it starts it.

## Usage
Download this folder and run **Check Microsoft Teams.app**. 
To run it with system open _Users and Groups_ in _System Preferences_, select your user, click on _Login Items, click on **+** button and select downloaded app.

## Improvements
- [ ] When starting **Check Microsoft Teams.app** add it to Login Items if it's not already there
- [ ] Add option to display icon while script is running in status bar instead of dock or don't show any icon at all
